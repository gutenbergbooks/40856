<p>When I began to write these stories about children of
all lands I had just returned from Europe whither I journeyed
with Marie and Ref. Maybe you don't know Marie
and Ref. I'll introduce them: Please meet Marie, my very
little daughter, and Ref, my very big reflex camera.</p>

<p>These two are my helpers. Marie helps by being a little
girl who knows what other little girls like and by telling
me; and Ref helps by snapping pictures of everything
interesting that Marie and I see on our travels. I couldn't
get along without them.</p>

<p>Several years have gone by since we started our work
together and Marie is a bigger girl&mdash;but Ref hasn't
changed one bit. Ref hasn't changed any more than my interest
in writing these books for you. And I hope that <i>you</i>
hope that I'll never change, because I want to keep on
writing until we'll have no more countries to write about&mdash;unless,
of course, some one discovers a new country.</p>

<p>Even if a new country isn't discovered, we'll find foreign
children to talk about&mdash;maybe the children in Mars! Who
knows? Nobody. Not even Marie&mdash;and Marie usually
knows about most things. That's the reason why, you see,
though I sign myself</p>

<div class="center"><br /><big>AND SOMETHING ABOUT THEM</big></div>

<p>Little Alden Allen looks so much like Philippe that he
might have stepped right out of this book. He is also a
sweet lovable little boy.</p>

<p>Lionel Belmore&mdash;well, just look at his jolly round face!
Isn't he Papa Pomme to perfection? Mr. Belmore is a
famous English actor, and he posed for Papa Pomme because
he loves to do all he can to please boys and girls.</p>

<p>Craufurd Kent is another famous English actor. And
although it is hard to believe, from looking at these savage
photographs, he also loves boys and girls and he hopes you
won't think him like Tom in real life. I can assure you he
isn't a bit, except that he whistles a lot and does it beautifully.</p>

<p>Seesil Anne Johnson is a talented little girl, who has
worked in many motion pictures. She seems to have Zelie's
sad eyes, though of course, she has no reason to be sad, and
she isn't. On the contrary, she is very happy, for she has
six brothers and sisters to play with.</p>

<p>Suzanne Ransom is another little motion picture girl, and
she is just like Philippe's Baby Rose. Don't you think so?</p>

<p>Now we come to the hero of the story, Philippe de Lacy.
Philippe's life itself is a story; only I could not tell it all
to you, for it would take most of the pages in this book to do
so. You may already know that Philippe is one of the best
beloved boy-actors in the world. Perhaps you do not know
that during the war, Philippe was found in a deserted village
in France and adopted by a kind English nurse. She
brought him to America, and today there is no happier pair
in Hollywood than these two. You see what a fine boy Philippe
has turned out to be. And I need not add that Miss de
Lacy is a proud mother.</p>

<p>In the book little Philippe's adventure started because of
that war picture which he saw with his father. In real life,
little Philippe's adventure also started because of the war.
But in the book Philippe's experience was not pleasant and
he was glad when it was over, while the real Philippe's
adventure was pleasant, and we are all glad for him that
it is going on and on.</p>

<h2>Chapter I<br />

THE BRUSSELS SPROUT</h2>


<p>The Brussels Sprout sat among the cabbages,
thinking.</p>

<p>The Brussels Sprout was not a little vegetable.
He was a little boy. His name was
really Philippe. But he was called "Petit
Choux de Bruxelles" (pe-tē´ shōō de brük-sel),
which means in French, "Little Brussels
Sprout." French is spoken in Brussels,
and this little boy was born in that city.</p>

<p>But he now lived on a farm a few miles
outside of Brussels.</p>

<p>The name "choux" (shōō) or "cabbage,"
is often used as a pet name. That was the
reason why Philippe's parents called him
Little Cabbage or Sprout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Sprout was a very good name for this little
boy, because new ideas were always sprouting
in his head.</p>

<p>He was always dreaming dreams and wishing
wishes. He was never satisfied.</p>

<p>One of his dearest wishes was for a little
sister.</p>

<p>Today he sat among the cabbages and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
thought deeply. He was wondering why one
of the cabbages did not open and give him
a baby sister.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus014.jpg" width="600" height="445" alt="SPROUT SAT AMONG THE CABBAGES" />
<span class="caption">SPROUT SAT AMONG THE CABBAGES</span>
</div>

<p>This may sound queer to you. But Philippe
was only five years old, and he believed very
earnestly that babies pop out of cabbages.</p>

<p>It is a Belgian folk tale. Philippe had
planted these cabbages in his garden for this
very purpose.</p>

<p>But no baby sister had popped out of a
cabbage yet.</p>

<p>Philippe wanted a baby sister with whom
to play. He was the kind of little boy who
always longed for something.</p>

<p>He was not really discontented. But he
liked new things to happen. And besides he
was a bit lonely on that farm, with nobody
to play with him.</p>

<p>"Why do you look so sad today, my little
cabbage?" asked his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">HE WAS NEVER SATISFIED</span>
</div>

<p>She had just come out of the house and
stood looking down at him.</p>

<p>"I am thinking that never will the baby,
Cauliflower, come!" he answered.</p>

<p>Cauliflower was what Philippe had determined
to name the sister for whom he longed.
Cauliflower in French is "choux fleur"
(shōō-flûr), which means "cabbage flower."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you quite certain that none of the cabbages
moved today?" asked Mother Yvelle
(ē-vĕl'), smiling strangely.</p>

<p>Philippe shook his head and replied, "They
are all quite still, Mamma. The little sister
is not coming."</p>

<p>Then Mother Yvelle laughed and threw
both arms about her little boy.</p>

<p>"Do not say that," she cried.</p>

<p>Philippe looked at her and saw a shiny
light in her eyes. Mother Yvelle said softly,
"Soon&mdash;soon&mdash;the great day is coming when
my Philippe shall be a little brother!"</p>

<p>A little brother! Philippe could hardly
believe the words that Mother Yvelle had
spoken. But it was true. Mother Yvelle
spoke only the truth.</p>

<p>When Mother Yvelle went into the house,
Philippe looked at each cabbage carefully.</p>

<img src="images/illus018.jpg" width="457" height="600" alt="MOTHER YVELLE" />
<span class="caption">MOTHER YVELLE</span>
</div>

<p>"Which one will it be?" he wondered ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a><br /><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>citedly.
"Which cabbage will open and give
me my little Cauliflower?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus019.jpg" width="600" height="514" alt="&quot;WHICH ONE WILL IT BE?&quot;" />
<span class="caption">"WHICH ONE WILL IT BE?"</span>
</div>

<p>Philippe was happy beyond all dreams. He
examined each vegetable. But he could find
no sign of the coming baby in any of them.</p>

<img src="images/illus023.jpg" width="600" height="490" alt="HE EXAMINED EACH VEGETABLE" />
<span class="caption">HE EXAMINED EACH VEGETABLE</span>
</div>

<p>He went to the barn. There he spoke to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the big dogs, his only companions. He told
them the great news.</p>

<p>These dogs did not have much time to play
with a little boy. They were usually working.
For Belgian dogs draw carts for their
owners.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus020.jpg" width="600" height="468" alt="BELGIAN DOGS DRAW CARTS FOR THEIR OWNERS" />
<span class="caption">BELGIAN DOGS DRAW CARTS FOR THEIR OWNERS</span>
</div>

<p>Philippe's mother had a big vegetable cart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Nearly every morning she loaded it with
peas and beans and carrots and onions. She
then hitched the dogs and drove them to
the market place in Brussels. Here she
would sit at a stand and sell her fresh vegetables.</p>

<p>Philippe usually went with her. But sometimes
he stayed at home with the gardener.</p>

<p>Philippe's father was a chef. Papa Paul
was a very fine chef and could cook some
of the best French and Belgian dishes.</p>

<p>He cooked in a fine restaurant in Brussels.
He came home late at night, and so Philippe
saw little of his father.</p>

<p>But he admired his father very much. He
wanted to cook the way his father did some
day. That was another great desire in the
heart of this little boy. Philippe dreamed
of some day becoming a chef like his father.</p>

<p>But he did not look like Papa Paul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Philippe's father was stout and round and
smiling. And Philippe was rather slender,
and had a serious little face with big dreamy
eyes. He was like his mother.</p>

<img src="images/illus022.jpg" width="368" height="600" alt="STOUT AND ROUND AND SMILING" />
<span class="caption">STOUT AND ROUND AND SMILING</span>
</div>

<p>Mother Yvelle was
thin and pale and
sad-looking.</p>

<p>You see, she and
her husband had lived
through the terrible
World War.</p>

<p>There are, however,
people whose dispositions
are so jolly that
they forget sadness.
Philippe's father was
one of these people.
Though Papa Paul wore a wooden leg, it did
not seem to affect his sunny smile. When
he was in the war he had been shot in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
leg, and now he wore a leg of wood. He had
been a chef only since the war.</p>

<p>Before the war Philippe's parents had
farmed and raised vegetables together. They
had been happy farmers. But their farm had
been blown to bits by the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Many stormy years passed, and many terrible
things happened to these poor people.
But finally the sunny smile won out. Here
was Papa Paul cooking in one of the best
restaurants in Belgium, while Mother Yvelle
was the farmer.</p>

<p>Mother Yvelle looked forward to the day
when Philippe should be old enough to help
her drive the dogs to town with the vegetables.</p>

<p>Philippe, too, wanted that day to come. He
wanted to drive the fine dogs to town.</p>

<p>From the barn he made his way to a tiny
shack, which was his own little kitchen.
Here he spent many hours over a small stove
his father had made for him. He prepared
dishes that he thought were very fine.</p>

<p>Today he had gathered some vegetables
and carried them with the other things he
had in his arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you going to cook today?" asked
the gardener, Emile (ā-mēl´).</p>

<p>He stood in the door holding a big rake
and looking amused.</p>

<p>"A stew&mdash;a very fine stew," answered
Philippe, and he began to pour a number of
things into a pot.</p>

<p>"What are you putting into the stew?"
asked Emile.</p>

<p>"Onions and peas, some rice, a nice little
fat snail and a root," the boy replied, as he
began to stir.</p>

<p>"A root? What kind of a root?" inquired
the gardener.</p>

<p>"Oh, a root that I found. A very big one.
I dug it up."</p>

<p>Emile laughed and moved on. One could
never tell what went into Philippe's stews.
Sometimes Emile was made to taste them.
Then he had to tell Philippe that the stews<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
were good. But Emile always had to drink
some water afterwards to wash away the taste.</p>

<p>But then Philippe was such a little boy. Besides,
the gardener felt sorry for him, because
he was lonesome.</p>

<p>Philippe called the gardener Emile Epinard
(ā-mēl´ ā-pē-när´), which means "Emile
Spinach." And, indeed, Emile did look like
a ragged leaf of spinach!</p>

<p>Philippe had a vegetable game. He always
tried to think what vegetable each person
looked like.</p>

<p>Then he would call that person by the
name of that vegetable. It was fun.</p>

<p>For instance, he always called his father
"Papa Pomme" (pōm), which means
"Father Apple." This name rather shocked
Mother Yvelle. But it pleased the jolly
round chef. He would tell his friends about
it and laugh until his fat sides shook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 540px;">
<img src="images/illus027.jpg" width="540" height="600" alt="PAPA POMME WAS A VERY FINE CHEF" />
<span class="caption">PAPA POMME WAS A VERY FINE CHEF</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Philippe had a friend whom he called
"String Bean Simon," another, "Celery
Susan," and many others he gave different
nicknames of the same kind.</p>

<p>As he was stirring his mixture, he suddenly
remembered that he had not told Emile the
great news.</p>

<p>"Oh, Emile Spinach, Emile Spinach," he
called, "did you know that soon, soon the
little sister will be here?"</p>

<p>But Emile Spinach had gone into the fields.</p>

<p>"This stew will be for the baby, Cauliflower,"
thought Philippe. "She will like
this stew."</p>

<p>Soon he heard his mother's voice calling
from the house, "Supper, my little one.
Come to supper."</p>

<p>Carrying his precious pot, he started toward
the cottage. On the way he once more
examined the cabbages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was still no sign of a baby in any
of them.</p>

<p>As he neared the house, he noticed a beautiful
rose growing near the wall.</p>

<p>It had been in full bloom the day before.
Now it was beginning to droop. Philippe
looked at it pityingly.</p>

<p>"Poor rose!" he said. "Tomorrow you will
be dead."</p>

<p>Then he went into the house.</p>

<p>The next morning Philippe arose early. He
ran to the cabbage patch. But the cabbages
all looked neat and whole. None had been
disturbed during the night.</p>

<p>"She has not come!" moaned poor Philippe.</p>

<p>Sadly he started toward the cottage, when
again he noticed the rose. But this time it
was only the stem he saw. The petals all
had fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>"Poor rose!" he sighed. "She is dead!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/illus030.jpg" width="582" height="600" alt="&quot;POOR ROSE,&quot; HE SAID" />
<span class="caption">"POOR ROSE," HE SAID</span>
</div>

<p>There was a step behind him. A heavy
hand was laid on his shoulder.</p>

<p>His father's deep, fine voice boomed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
"What are you saying, my little cabbage?"</p>

<p>"Poor rose is dead!" answered Philippe
sadly.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Papa Pomme. "Why,
Baby Rose is born!"</p>

<p>"Baby Rose?" questioned Philippe.</p>

<p>"Yes, my son," Papa Pomme said. "Your
little sister came to us last night&mdash;your little
sister Rose."</p>

<p>Philippe leaped up and threw his arms
about his father's neck in a burst of joy.
At last his little sister was here! Then he
looked at the dead rose, and from it, to the
live and healthy cabbages. He smiled knowingly.</p>

<p>"Papa Pomme," he said, "it was not from
the cabbage that Baby came. So, you see,
she shall not be our Cauliflower. It was the
rose that opened to give her to us. That is
why she is our Baby Rose."</p>

<h2>Chapter II<br />

PAPA POMME'S SURPRISE</h2>


<p>For over a year now Philippe, the little
Brussels Sprout, had been going to the market
place with Emile Spinach. Mother had
to stay at home with Baby Rose.</p>

<p>Philippe felt himself almost a man now.
If only Emile would stay at home and let
him drive the dogs alone! Ah, that would
be heaven, indeed. Another dream was to
bring his precious Baby Rose to the market
place some day. Philippe was always wishing
wishes.</p>

<p>Rose was so tiny. At first she could only
laugh at Philippe's happy face as he bent
over her cradle. She pulled his hair or
clutched his finger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Now she could stand alone and say a word
or two. She was beautiful. She was fair and
dainty, and her eyes were as blue as a summer
sky. How Philippe loved his Baby Rose!</p>

<p>Soon Mother had promised to bring her
to the market place. What a proud boy
Philippe would be when he might set her
upon the low cart on top of the vegetables
and drive her to town! The fine, sleek dogs
would be proud, too, knowing that a rare
flower rested upon their vegetable load.</p>

<p>Philippe had a sweet voice and sang a
number of Belgian folk songs. He was beginning
to teach his Rose a little vegetable
song which he had made up.</p>

<p>He had a fine plan. He wanted to station
Rose in the market place, and have her sing
for the passers-by. How proud the little fellow
was of his baby sister!</p>

<p>Today as he walked along beside the sturdy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
dogs, he sang gayly. He was happier than
usual. Today an exciting thing was to happen.
Papa Pomme had told him that he
would call at the market place and take him
to lunch. Papa Pomme did not often do
this. But today he was given the afternoon
to himself.</p>

<p>Papa had put his finger to his lips and said
mysteriously to Philippe, "You shall dine
with me, little one; and then, in the afternoon&mdash;ah,
you shall see!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 367px;">
<img src="images/illus035.jpg" width="367" height="600" alt="&quot;AH, YOU SHALL SEE&quot;" />
<span class="caption">"AH, YOU SHALL SEE"</span>
</div>

<p>So as Philippe walked along, he wondered
what surprise his father had planned for the
afternoon. When he reached the market
place, or Grande Place (grän pläs), as it is
called in French, he helped Emile Spinach
unload the vegetables. Many other farmers
were arranging their wares. Some sold beautiful
flowers, and others sold fruits. There
were portions of the square set aside for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
sellers of birds and dogs and all manner of
different articles.</p>

<p>The Grande Place in Brussels is one of the
most beautiful places of its kind in the world.
There stands the city
hall, built half a century
before America
was discovered.
There are many other
beautiful, gilded
buildings. The
Grande Place in
Brussels shines in the
splendor of past
glory.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus038.jpg" width="600" height="466" alt="SOME SOLD BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS" />
<span class="caption">SOME SOLD BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS</span>
</div>

<p>Here sat the little
boy, Philippe, and
helped sell his mother's vegetables. He often
glanced at the clock and hoped his father
would not be late. He wanted to know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Papa Pomme was planning for the afternoon.</p>

<p>Papa Pomme was on time. He took his
son by the hand. They made their way to
a restaurant, where little tables were placed
out on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Here people sat in leisurely style, eating
hearty dinners. The jolly-faced chef and his
little son settled themselves at a corner table.
The menu before them was indeed tempting.</p>

<p>Although Philippe was anxious to know
his father's surprise, he could not allow it
to stand in the way of his appetite. How
could any boy do that?</p>

<p>Belgian food is tempting to everyone. It
is as dainty as the French food. It is as
wholesome as the Dutch. And it has something
about it that is neither French nor
Dutch, but purely Belgian.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reason lies in the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Belgium is so small. It is a matter of only
a few hours for vegetables and fruits to
travel from a distant farm to a Brussels table.
Therefore, all food is fresh.</p>

<p>Papa Pomme ordered "potage," the famous
thick soup, dear to all the French and Belgians.
Then they had a roast, and for dessert,
strawberries and a huge plate of gingerbread.
Belgian strawberries and gingerbread are
very famous and are said to be the best in the
world.</p>

<p>While they ate, they did not talk. Eating
was a serious matter with Papa Pomme and
Philippe.</p>

<p>So absorbed did Philippe become that he
forgot his manners. He reached across the
table and pulled toward him the long loaf
of French bread.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" cried Papa Pomme. "Not so
fast! Come! Do you not use your tongue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
when you want something which is beyond
your reach?"</p>

<p>Philippe blushed. Then he replied stoutly,
"Yes, Papa Pomme; but my arm is much
longer than my tongue!"</p>

<p>Papa Pomme laughed and gained another
pound. Philippe went on eating happily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>When they left the restaurant they walked
down the street together.</p>

<p>"Papa Pomme, where are you taking me?"
asked Philippe, puzzled.</p>

<p>For Papa Pomme was acting in a very mysterious
way.</p>

<p>"Do not ask yet!" he said. "Soon you
shall see."</p>

<p>Soon Philippe did see. For they stopped
in front of a big theater. In Europe a motion
picture theater is called a cinema.</p>

<p>"Now, little Philippe," laughed Papa
Pomme, "you know my surprise!"</p>

<p>Philippe threw his cap in the air and
shouted, "Hooray! The cinema!"</p>

<p>It was a special treat to the little boy to
be taken to the cinema! He had been to
one only once before in his life.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus040.jpg" width="600" height="463" alt="GRANDE PLACE, BRUSSELS" />
<span class="caption">GRANDE PLACE, BRUSSELS</span>
</div>

<p>They were to see a great film today. It
was the story of the World War and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a><br /><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
part that little Belgium had played. It showed
how the enemy had started to march through
Belgium in order to reach Paris. It showed
how the loyal Belgians and their brave King
Albert had helped the Allies to win their
victory by stopping that march.</p>

<p>Long ago a treaty had been made which
said that no nation should take an army
through Belgium to attack another nation.
If ever such a thing happened, it was Belgium's
duty to stop them. In the year 1914,
an enemy did try to go through her land.
Belgium might have neglected her duty. She
might have remained quiet and allowed the
enemy to pass. Had she done this, she would
never have been destroyed as she was. The
enemy would have marched quietly through
and left Belgium to its peaceful life.</p>

<p>The film showed how the Belgians fought.
Still Belgium could not hold out against so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
powerful an enemy. At last she was conquered.
But when that time came, the
French were ready, and so were the English.
So Paris was saved.</p>

<p>The audience shouted and clapped. But
after that came sighs. The film showed how
pitiful and sad was this poor little Belgium
after the war.</p>

<p>That film left in the heart of Philippe a
new dream. It was that film which was really
the cause of the little boy's later adventures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter III<br />

A NEIGHBOR</h2>


<p>Five years passed. Philippe was now a tall
boy of eleven. He was still called Sprout,
and he was still full of wishing dreams and
dreaming wishes.</p>

<p>But those dreams and wishes had changed
since the time when he had longed for a baby
sister. Of course, he never stopped being
glad about Rose. She was the dearest little
sister that a boy could have.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 456px;">
<img src="images/illus044.jpg" width="456" height="600" alt="LITTLE ROSE" />
<span class="caption">LITTLE ROSE</span>
</div>

<p>Philippe's desire to be a cook had disappeared.
He had changed since that day
when Papa Pomme had taken him to the
cinema. For Philippe never forgot the film
he had seen.</p>

<p>Philippe never forgot those terrible battle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a><br /><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>scenes. Often his eyes would fill with tears
at the thought of the sad struggle and the
bravery of his little country.</p>

<p>The boy who had once dreamed of vegetables
now had other dreams. The little boy,
who had wanted some day to be a chef, now
longed to become a great hero like his own
country's king. He longed to do a great deed
himself and to have adventures. But all he
could do was to sell vegetables.</p>

<p>No, that was not all. Now he could read
about his country. And he did. Philippe
read and read. Every book he could find
he devoured. Stories of Belgium's cities and
people Philippe learned and loved. Tales of
wonder kept him interested for hours.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus045.jpg" width="600" height="511" alt="PHILIPPE READ AND READ" />
<span class="caption">PHILIPPE READ AND READ</span>
</div>

<p>"If only I might travel and have adventures!"
sighed the little vegetable boy.</p>

<p>He was now old enough to drive the dog-cart
to market alone. He went each day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
with Baby Rose perched on top of the vegetables,
laughing and gurgling with joy.</p>

<p>All the way to town Philippe sang with his
little sister. When they reached the Grande
Place, he set the baby upon the counter.
Then the little girl, with her golden curls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and her sunny smile, and the tall, handsome
boy, with his wavy hair and his dreamy eyes,
sang and attracted many people to the booth.
It did not take them long to sell their vegetables.</p>

<p>Now as Philippe unloaded his produce, he
did not know that today something unusual
was going to happen. Rose fluttered about
and filled the dogs' drinking bowl. All dog-carts
in Belgium carry drinking bowls, and
a bit of carpet for the animals to lie down
upon. Rose filled the bowl, and the huge
beasts licked her hands with gratitude.</p>

<p>There was a new member of the dog family
who had come to town with them today. It
was Trompke (trŏmp'-ky). Trompke was a
puppy. He did not work. He was Philippe's
own puppy.</p>

<p>"Trompke" means "tambourine" in Brussels
French. The puppy was thus named
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a><br /><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
because he had such a fat little round tummy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 525px;">
<img src="images/illus048.jpg" width="525" height="600" alt="TROMPKE" />
<span class="caption">TROMPKE</span>
</div>

<p>Trompke loved Philippe. Today was the
first time he had been allowed to follow the
cart to town. He was wild with excitement.</p>

<p>"Stop barking, Trompke!" commanded
Philippe, as he arranged the vegetables on
the stand.</p>

<p>"Lie down, Tum-Tum," cried Baby Rose.</p>

<p>And Trompke lay at the baby's feet.</p>

<p>Just then Philippe noticed some one in the
booth next to their own. A tall man was
moving about arranging vegetables. This
booth had not been used for a very long
time.</p>

<p>"Now," thought Philippe, "we shall have a
neighbor."</p>

<p>Philippe smiled at the man, who was staring
at the two children. Then the man
looked down at the puppy, which was whining
unhappily at Philippe's feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Keep him quiet," said the man angrily.</p>

<p>Philippe answered, "He means no harm.
He is only excited. It's his first trip to town."</p>

<p>The man did not answer but turned toward
his vegetables. Philippe was puzzled. He
had never before met anyone like his neighbor.</p>

<p>The man wore ragged clothes, and his face
was sunburned. His eyes were coal black
and seemed to flash fire. He had a wild look
about him. He was tall and moved like a
cat.</p>

<p>Suddenly he leaned over toward Philippe.</p>

<p>"Keep that dog quiet, will you?" he
snarled.</p>

<p>Trompke was still whining softly, though
he could hardly be heard.</p>

<p>"He does no harm," answered Philippe.</p>

<p>The man's flashing eyes gleamed as he replied,
"He keeps the people away. Nobody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
has come to buy at the booths yet. It is the
fault of that dog."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus051.jpg" width="600" height="535" alt="&quot;LIE DOWN, TUM-TUM!&quot;" />
<span class="caption">"LIE DOWN, TUM-TUM!"</span>
</div>

<p>Philippe could only smile at such stupidity.
To think that a little whining dog could keep
people away! But the man seemed nervous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>So Philippe said, "Just wait, sir. I will
have the crowds here in a short time. Come,
Rose; let us sing!"</p>

<p>Little Rose stood upon the counter. She
looked like a big doll. Her golden curls
shone in the sunlight. Philippe stood by her
side, and together they sang in voices clear
and sweet. They sang the little nonsense
song that Philippe had made up for his sister.
It ran:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"I wouldn't be an artichoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And have my heart torn out,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I wouldn't be a lettuce,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With my head thrown all about,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'd hate to be a cornstalk,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For folk my ears would pull;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Potatoes must feel dreadful<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'Cause with dirt their eyes are full."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A few people began to wander over to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
vegetable booth. They stood and watched
the two children. They smiled at the quaint
little vegetable boy, and looked admiringly
at the pretty baby. Then the children began
their second stanza, as more and more people
gathered around the booth.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"It must be hard for spinach, too;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His leaves are never read;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Poor mushroom, with the fairy folk<br /></span>
<span class="i4">All sitting on his head!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Old Mr. Onion grieves so much.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He makes us all boohoo!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'm glad I'm not a vegetable,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But just a child. Aren't you?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many people had now crowded round and
some began to buy vegetables. Philippe was
kept busy serving them. Baby Rose smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and dimpled at everyone. She sang other
songs that Philippe had made up. Then she
sang "The <ins title ="Transcriber's Note: original reads Brabanconne">Brabançonne</ins>" (brȧ-bän-sōn'),
Belgium's national anthem.</p>

<p>The vegetables were slowly disappearing.
But from the booth next door, not a vegetable
was bought. Philippe cast a look in
the direction of the tall dark man, who was
standing with his arms folded.</p>

<p>Philippe looked down at the man's vegetables.
For the first time he noticed that
they were not fresh. They were wilted and
stale.</p>

<p>"It is no wonder the people do not buy,"
thought Philippe.</p>

<p>But he felt sorry, nevertheless. When the
crowd had left, and the selling was over, he
turned to the man.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," he said. "But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Philippe was going to tell him that people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
will not buy stale vegetables. But the man
interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I do not need your advice,"
he said.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus055.jpg" width="600" height="433" alt="&quot;THANK YOU, BUT I DO NOT NEED YOUR ADVICE,&quot; HE SAID" />
<span class="caption">"THANK YOU, BUT I DO NOT NEED YOUR ADVICE," HE SAID</span>
</div>

<p>Philippe watched him as he began to throw
his vegetables into a barrel and prepare to
leave. He whistled as he did so.</p>

<p>Philippe lifted Rose from the counter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
they, too, made preparations for departure.</p>

<p>All the way home, the boy seemed to see
before him that stranger's face.</p>

<p>When the children reached home, a surprise
awaited them.</p>

<p>"Papa Pomme is home! Hurrah!" cried
Philippe.</p>

<p>Sometimes Papa Pomme came home to
dinner, and that was a great treat. But
this evening Papa Pomme looked grave. He
began to talk with Mother Yvelle. Philippe
listened.</p>

<p>"They say that this thief has stolen
from several farms about here," said Papa
Pomme. "You had better warn Emile to
watch."</p>

<p>"A thief, Papa?" asked Philippe, whose
eyes were very big.</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy," Papa Pomme replied. "A
man who goes about at night stealing vege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>tables
from people's farms&mdash;a vegetable thief.
I wish they could catch him. It is very hard
for the poor farmers to have their produce
stolen. This thief is a wicked man."</p>

<p>Philippe suddenly thought of his dark
neighbor in the market place. Could it be&mdash;&mdash;?
Oh, no.</p>

<p>Still there were those stale vegetables. But
Philippe refused to think of such a thing.</p>

<p>"Papa," he asked, "if this thief is caught,
what will they do with him?"</p>

<p>"They will put him in prison, my son,"
answered Papa Pomme.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter IV<br />

ZELIE</h2>


<p>Philippe did not know how nearly right he
had been. He had wondered whether his
neighbor in the market place could be the
thief.</p>

<p>But Philippe did not like to think evil of
people, so he drove away that thought. But
the tall dark man was really the vegetable
thief.</p>

<p>Next day when Philippe arrived at the
Grande Place, he looked for his neighbor.
Yes, there was the man with another load
of stale vegetables. He was piling them upon
his counter.</p>

<p>Today Philippe noticed that there was a
little girl with him. She was helping him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
spread out the wilted vegetables. Philippe
did not know that during the night this evil
man had stolen those vegetables from a poor
farmer.</p>

<p>He had stolen them and now he had
brought them to the market place to sell.
They were not fresh like Philippe's vegetables,
because the thief did not know how
to take care of them.</p>

<p>The little girl with Philippe's neighbor
glanced shyly at the boy. She was dark like
the man. But her face was not like his. It
was sweet and pretty.</p>

<p>Suddenly Philippe was surprised to hear
the man call out cheerily: "Good morning
to you, friend, and to the little golden-haired
singing bird."</p>

<p>The man had changed from the day before.
Philippe now rather liked his weather-beaten
face. It was all wrinkled with smiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good morning to you, sir," answered
Philippe.</p>

<p>"This is Zelie, my little daughter," said the
fellow, still smiling. "Zelie, go over and
shake hands with the boy and with the little
singing bird. You must get acquainted."</p>

<p>Zelie obeyed. She seemed a shy but pleasant
little girl. She was a year or so younger
than Philippe. Her black hair hung straight
from under a gypsy-like bandanna. She wore
earrings in her ears. Her eyes were black,
but they did not flash. They smiled at
Philippe.</p>

<p>The two children talked. Philippe found
Zelie bright and interesting. She had traveled
a great deal. She spoke of her travels
about the country.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus061.jpg" width="600" height="581" alt="THE TWO CHILDREN TALKED" />
<span class="caption">THE TWO CHILDREN TALKED</span>
</div>

<p>While the morning passed, the two children
became friends.</p>

<p>As before, the boy and his sister sold their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
fresh fine vegetables. People gathered around
their booth and clapped for their singing.
But nobody stopped to buy from the man
beside them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>Still, instead of being jealous of Philippe,
the stranger kept smiling at his neighbor.
When the crowd had gone and it was time
to start for home, the man came over to
Philippe's booth.</p>

<p>"Did my Zelie tell you of her travels?" he
asked Philippe.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied the boy eagerly. "What
great fortune to be able to wander about the
country as you do, sir!"</p>

<p>The man looked at Philippe with those
flashing eyes.</p>

<p>Then he said, "You could do so, too. You
and the singing bird could earn great sums
of money wandering about and singing. Why
not go?"</p>

<p>Philippe started. Such a thing had never
entered his mind. Though he had dreamed
of adventure and travel, it had been only a
dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't, sir," he answered. "My
mother would not let me go."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed the man good-naturedly.
"It would not be hard to persuade her. Tell
her that Zelie and I will take you with us
and you will be as safe and comfortable as
you are at home."</p>

<p>Philippe wrinkled his brow. Then he began
to prepare to go home. Somehow, this
plan was a little startling. Still, it did tempt
him.</p>

<p>He seemed to like the man much better
today. Zelie, too, was a splendid companion.
All the way home Philippe thought hard.</p>

<p>As the days passed, he grew to like Zelie
and her father more and more. Zelie showed
Philippe many delightful souvenirs from
many parts of Belgium. She had also journeyed
to other countries and spoke of those
lands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>She was always sweet and happy. But
Philippe sometimes wondered why there was
a frightened look in her eyes. That frightened
look came when she was with her
father. She seemed to lose it when she sat
talking with Philippe.</p>

<p>The man, whose name was Tom, asked
Philippe one day, "Will you teach Zelie to
sing your songs? They are so clever and
bright."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," promised Philippe.</p>

<p>So he taught Zelie all of the little songs
that he and Rose sang.</p>

<p>Today the sun was shining in the market
place, and birds were singing. Philippe felt
full of gladness. He met Zelie and her father,
who had a smile on his face.</p>

<p>"What a fine day for traveling!" he cried.
"How I should like to start out and wander
to far places!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom's sly eyes beamed. He slapped
Philippe on the back lightly.</p>

<p>"That is just what Zelie and I are planning,"
he said. "Tomorrow we leave. Why
could not you and the singing bird go with
us?</p>

<p>"We shall go to every part of Belgium and
take along our big organ. Zelie will play the
organ, while you and Baby Rose sing."</p>

<p>Philippe's heart pounded. Yes, why not?
He looked at Zelie. He thought she must be
delighted. But he was amazed to see a look
of fear in her little dark face.</p>

<p>"What luck!" he cried. "Are you not
pleased, Zelie?"</p>

<p>"If you would come it might be jolly," the
girl answered.</p>

<p>"Why not?" again thought Philippe. He
said, "I'll ask my mother and father tonight.
I shall tell you in the morning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good!" Tom smiled. "Zelie and I can
wait until the following day to start our journey.
Then we four shall set out together."</p>

<p>That night Philippe asked his parents if he
might go traveling
with Tom and Zelie.</p>

<p>"This is a strange
man," said Papa
Pomme. "How do
you know that he
may not be a wicked
man? Besides, a wandering
life is a hard
one, and Baby Rose
is too young."</p>

<p>"But I am old
and strong, Papa
Pomme," begged Philippe. "I shall make
great sums of money, too. Do, do let me go."</p>

<p>"Not yet, little cabbage," said Papa Pomme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">"NOT YET, LITTLE CABBAGE"</span>
</div>

<p>Philippe's dream was shattered. He cried
himself to sleep that night.</p>

<p>The next day in the market place Tom met
the children with an eager question.</p>

<p>"Well? Do we start tomorrow?" he asked.</p>

<p>"My father will not let me go," Philippe
said.</p>

<p>The man scowled.</p>

<p>"Foolish," he frowned, "foolish! It would
bring you money, and you could make your
parents rich."</p>

<p>Philippe scowled, too.</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed, "I told my father. But
still he refuses to allow me to go."</p>

<p>"It is too bad," the man said. He shrugged
his shoulders. "But Zelie and I must leave
tomorrow. And maybe some day you will
decide to join us."</p>

<p>Philippe wondered what Tom meant.</p>

<p>"You know you are a big boy now," Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
continued. "It is a shame for you to waste
your time sitting in a market place selling
vegetables."</p>

<p>He winked at Philippe slyly, and then
started to whistle. Oh, how lucky was this
Tom, thought Philippe; and the little girl,
Zelie, too! But still Philippe noticed that
Zelie's eyes were sad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter V<br />

NEW FRIENDS</h2>


<p>Philippe lay in bed and thought of Tom
and of Zelie. Yes, mostly he thought of Zelie.
He would never see her again. Tom was
taking her away in the morning. What a
pity!</p>

<p>She was the most interesting little friend
the boy had ever had. Now he would be
lonely again. Rose was still so young.</p>

<p>Of course, he had his books. But he did
so long to wander through the country. It
was summer time, and there was no school.
Oh, happy Zelie!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus070.jpg" width="600" height="537" alt="HE DID SO LONG TO WANDER THROUGH THE COUNTRY" />
<span class="caption">HE DID SO LONG TO WANDER THROUGH THE COUNTRY</span>
</div>

<p>"But was she really happy?" Philippe wondered.</p>

<p>She had once told him that she had to push<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the big organ about while they begged their
way.</p>

<p>It was a heavy thing, that organ, and
Philippe had asked, "Doesn't it tire you,
Zelie?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Zelie had looked quickly at her father and
had caught Tom's gleaming eye.</p>

<p>"No," she had replied, "it is fun."</p>

<p>Philippe had envied her. If he might go
along, he could push the organ for her. He
was strong. And he might help Tom, too.</p>

<p>Philippe did not know what his friend Tom
was doing just at this moment. As Philippe
lay in his comfortable little bed, he did not
know that Tom was stealing his father's vegetables.
Philippe did not know that poor Zelie
was right under the window with Tom, helping
to steal Papa Pomme's vegetables.</p>

<p>The next morning Emile Spinach ran into
the house, very much excited.</p>

<p>"The vegetable thief has been in the garden,
sir!" he cried to Papa Pomme.</p>

<p>Sure enough, their little farm had been
robbed.</p>

<p>When Philippe and Rose arrived at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
market place, the booth next to theirs was
empty.</p>

<p>Of course Philippe never dreamed that
Tom was the thief. He missed his neighbors
sadly. He pictured them pushing along the
organ and playing in market places all over
Belgium. He thought of them strolling along
the pleasant roads.</p>

<p>He could hear Tom's gay whistle. He could
see Zelie's little dark face. He wondered
whether Zelie would sing the songs he had
taught her. She had a pretty voice. She was
not so small and cunning as Baby Rose, but
she had a charm of her own.</p>

<p>Philippe became discontented. He sometimes
wandered about the streets instead of
staying in the market place. Of course, he
only did this when Emile Spinach was there
to stay with Rose.</p>

<p>Philippe was quieter than usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Papa Pomme said one day to Mother
Yvelle, "I am worried about the boy. He is
different. Something bothers him."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus073.jpg" width="600" height="519" alt="&quot;SOMETHING BOTHERS HIM&quot;" />
<span class="caption">"SOMETHING BOTHERS HIM"</span>
</div>

<p>Papa Pomme did worry about Philippe.
Papa Pomme worried so much that once he
put sugar in the soup and salt in the pastry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
The manager of the restaurant scolded Papa
Pomme.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 371px;">
<img src="images/illus074.jpg" width="371" height="600" alt="PUT SALT IN THE PASTRY" />
<span class="caption">PUT SALT IN THE PASTRY</span>
</div>

<p>One day Philippe was walking toward his
father's restaurant. As he approached, a taxicab
drove up and
stopped a few doors
away. Two gentlemen
stepped out.</p>

<p>Philippe smiled as
he heard one of the
gentlemen ask the
taxi driver, "Can you
direct us to a restaurant?"</p>

<p>The gentleman had
a very funny French
accent. He continued,
"We have heard so much about this delicious
Belgian food. We are very hungry."</p>

<p>The taxi driver must have been hungry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
too. He evidently wanted to be off to his
own lunch.</p>

<p>For he replied sharply, "There are many
restaurants. Just walk along any street. They
can always be smelled!"</p>

<p>The unobliging taxi driver laughed at his
own stupid joke. Then he started his motor
and was off.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen stood for a moment
looking at each other. Then one said something
in a language that Philippe did not understand.
But he felt sure that it was English.</p>

<p>The little boy walked over to the gentlemen.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sirs," he began in French. "I
heard you asking for a place to eat. I can
take you to the best restaurant in Brussels."</p>

<p>The gentlemen looked at the little Belgian
boy standing before them. Then one of them
smiled and said something in English to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
other. Philippe did not understand the
words, but if you had been there you would
have heard the gentleman say to his friend,
"Let us take his word for it. He may know
something about food. Boys usually do."</p>

<p>The other one laughed and said in French
to Philippe, "Thank you. We shall be glad
to follow you."</p>

<p>Of course, Philippe led the gentlemen to
his father's restaurant. He held the door
open for them to enter, and started to leave.</p>

<p>But the gentleman who spoke French said,
"Come! Wouldn't you like to lunch with us?
You might tell us a bit about the art of Belgian
eating. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Philippe.</p>

<p>He could always eat. His dreams did not
prevent that.</p>

<p>So the two foreign gentlemen and the little
Belgian boy sat down to lunch. Philippe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
showed them how a Belgian orders a meal.
They were amused at the child's knowledge
of all these fine dishes. They asked him how
he knew so much. Philippe then told them
about Papa Pomme.</p>

<p>"Aha!" exclaimed the gentleman who
spoke French. "It is a fine thing for a boy
to have a papa who is a chef. Is it not?"</p>

<p>Philippe laughed and agreed. Then the
same gentleman told about himself. He said,
"My friend and I are touring through Belgium.
My friend is an American. It is his
first trip over here. I am from England. We
are leaving tomorrow for Antwerp. Today
we are going to see the sights of Brussels."</p>

<p>Philippe did full justice to the food spread
before him. The men watched the hungry
boy with great amusement.</p>

<p>The Englishman said, "Well, I must say
you do eat well!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Philippe stopped long enough to look up
into his face and reply roguishly, "Yes, sir.
I have been practicing all my life!"</p>

<p>The two gentlemen laughed. The Englishman
had, of course, translated the words to
his friend. They thought Philippe a very
jolly lad. They did not know how really discontented
he was. How little we can tell
sometimes by looking at people what is really
going on in their hearts!</p>

<p>"But now tell us," asked the Englishman.
"Have you always lived in Brussels?"</p>

<p>"I have lived here all my life," Philippe answered.
He then added timidly, "If you
would like me to take you around the city
after lunch I could show you many interesting
sights. There are few places I do not
know in Brussels."</p>

<p>"An excellent plan," cried the Englishman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 464px;">
<img src="images/illus079.jpg" width="464" height="600" alt="PLACE DE BRUGÈRE, BRUSSELS" />
<span class="caption">PLACE DE BRUGÈRE, BRUSSELS</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he told his friend, the American, what
the Belgian boy had offered to do.</p>

<p>"Good!" said the American in English.
"And I hope he knows as much about cities
as he does about food. For then we shall
find our minds stuffed as full as our stomachs!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter VI<br />

PHILIPPE ACTS AS GUIDE</h2>


<p>Philippe was a very good guide. He had
learned much through his reading. Now he
was able to show his new friends many interesting
sights in Brussels. Also, he knew
stories about all of them.</p>

<p>Brussels has been called "Paris in Little."
This is because it is beautiful like Paris,
with boulevards, similar buildings, and lovely
parks. They passed avenues shaded by
fine old lime trees. They admired statues
and fountains all over the city.</p>

<p>Philippe led the two gentlemen to the
palace of the King. The little Brussels boy
pointed out a long stately building which
stands just opposite a fine park.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"So this is the palace of good King Albert!"
remarked the English gentleman. "He is
considered a great ruler."</p>

<p>"He is," smiled Philippe, "and we love
him."</p>

<p>Then the boy continued seriously, "But we
Belgians and even King Albert do not like
the idea of a kingdom."</p>

<p>"No?" inquired the Englishman, in a surprised
tone.</p>

<p>"You know Englishmen are very true to
their King."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have read in my books that they
are," replied Philippe. "But we have good
reasons for continuing with a monarchy.
First, because of our love for King Albert,
and then because we are afraid that without
our kingdom we should split up. And you
know that our motto is 'In union there is
strength.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"But why do you fear being split up, as you
say?" inquired the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Because," answered Philippe, "on one
side of us is France, a republic; on the other
side is Germany, also a republic. We Belgians
are very close to both these countries
because of many things. We are like them in
many ways and we trade with them. We fear
that without our King to hold us together
we might become part of these countries.
And we are very patriotic. We never want
to be anything but Belgian!"</p>

<p>The little fellow stood and saluted the flag,
which was flying from the palace.</p>

<p>"See! The flag!" said Philippe, pointing to
the red, yellow, and black colors fluttering
in the breeze. "I can tell you about that, also,
if you would like me to do so."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the Englishman. Then
he turned to his friend, the American, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
said, "The little chap is just full of stories."</p>

<p>"That may be," replied the friend, "but I
do not understand a word. It all sounds like
Chinese to me!"</p>

<p>"Wait," laughed the Englishman. "I shall
translate them to you later."</p>

<p>So Philippe told about his flag.</p>

<p>"The black in the flag is the King's color,"
said he. "It stands for constancy, wisdom,
and prudence. The yellow stands for law and
order. And red is for Belgium's liberty,
fought for and obtained by the blood of her
soldiers."</p>

<p>As they walked along the shady streets the
English gentleman explained to his friend all
that Philippe had said. The American
nodded his head understandingly.</p>

<p>"That is very interesting," he said. "I do
not blame the Belgians for being loyal to
their King. They have good reasons."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">PALACE OF THE KING, BRUSSELS</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sure you would like to visit Waterloo,"
suggested Philippe. "I need not tell you
the story of Waterloo," he smiled, "for everybody
who has ever studied history knows
about that."</p>

<p>But those who have not yet studied history
may want to know that it is a famous battlefield
where many wars were fought. The
most famous of the battles was the struggle
between the Duke of Wellington, who commanded
the English army, and Napoleon
Bonaparte who led the French.</p>

<p>When Philippe and his new friends had
looked about for a while, the American gentleman
remarked, "So this is where Napoleon
met his Waterloo!"</p>

<p>It was here that Napoleon was conquered!
That is why we still use the expression "met
his Waterloo" when we mean to say "was
defeated."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">BRUSSELS HAS MANY FINE BOULEVARDS</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Philippe showed them the "Mound of the
Lion," that great pyramid-shaped monument
on the battlefield.</p>

<p>"It was built after the Battle of Waterloo,
in memory of the Prince of Orange," he explained.
"It is as large as a city block. The
huge lion on the top is made of metal from
captured French cannons. You know that
the lion is the emblem of Belgium. The
mound was built almost entirely by women
who carried the dirt in pails."</p>

<p>Driving back to the city, the Englishman
remarked, "It seems to me that tea time is
approaching."</p>

<p>The little boy knew how important tea time
is to Englishmen. So he suggested an excellent
café where they might sit outside and
watch the people.</p>

<p>While they were eating, Philippe explained
to the Englishman how he loved to read. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
told of his interest in the stories of his land.</p>

<p>"Then you do not want to be a chef some
day like your father?" asked the gentleman.</p>

<p><ins title ="Transcriber's Note: original reads Philipp">Philippe shook his head.</ins></p>

<p>"I want to do great things," he answered.
"To travel, to have adventures."</p>

<p>The Englishman smiled.</p>

<p>"That is very natural," he remarked. He
told his friend, the American, what the boy
had said. His friend laughed.</p>

<p>"That sounds like an American boy," he
said. "Ask him what he wants to do."</p>

<p>The Englishman asked Philippe this question.</p>

<p>The boy answered, "Oh, I should like to go
to Antwerp (ănt´-w[~e]rp) and Ghent (gĕnt)
and see the sights of Belgium, because I
know so many stories about everything."</p>

<p>He then told them about his wandering
friends, Tom and Zelie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">MODERN BRUSSELS IS WELL LAID OUT WITH MANY WIDE AVENUES</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The Englishman remarked, "That is a hard
life. It is much better to travel in a motor
car." Then he smiled pleasantly and continued,
"That is the way we travel. We are
leaving for Antwerp tomorrow in our car."</p>

<p>Philippe's eyes shone. Here were more
traveling folks. It seemed to the boy that
everyone in the world was traveling except
himself.</p>

<p>And while Philippe was thus thinking, the
gentlemen were talking together in English.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Englishman turned to Philippe
and asked, "How would you like to
come along with us to Antwerp? You would
make an excellent guide, since you know so
much about the country."</p>

<p>Philippe's heart almost stopped beating.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," he breathed, "that is very good
of you." Then he hesitated. "But my father
would not let me go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is your father?" asked the gentleman.</p>

<p>"At the restaurant where we lunched, sir.
He is in the kitchen,"
replied Philippe.</p>

<p>"Very well; let us
go and see him," suggested
the Englishman.</p>

<p>Philippe led the
gentlemen back to
the restaurant. They
followed him into the
big kitchen.</p>

<p>There Philippe began to introduce them
to Papa Pomme.</p>

<p>But the Englishman and Papa Pomme
stared at one another and then they both
cried out together, "Well, well, well!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;">
<img src="images/illus092.jpg" width="453" height="600" alt="&quot;WELL, WELL, WELL&quot;" />
<span class="caption">"WELL, WELL, WELL"</span>
</div>

<p>Philippe was surprised to see that Papa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Pomme and this English gentleman already
knew each other. They were very happy to
meet again.</p>

<p>Papa Pomme turned to Philippe and said,
"My boy, here you see a war-time friend of
your father's. We were soldiers together in
the World War. This gentleman was a great
hero!"</p>

<p>The Englishman interrupted, "Oh, no, no,
my friend, not so great a hero as you."</p>

<p>Then he looked at Papa Pomme's wooden
leg and they both grew serious.</p>

<p>"But come! We have something to ask
you," the gentleman suddenly observed.
"My friend and I are going to Antwerp tomorrow.
Will you allow your son to go
along? We promise to take good care of him,
and I'm sure he'll take splendid care of us.
For you know, he has guided us through
Brussels all day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Papa Pomme fairly beamed with pride.</p>

<p>Then he said, "It is very kind of you, and
I am delighted to have my Philippe go along
with you. He has wanted so much to travel.
Eh, little Philippe?"</p>

<p>And he pulled the boy's hair playfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Papa," joyfully agreed Philippe.</p>

<p>Papa Pomme continued, "And this time, I
know that you will be safe, for you will be
with an old friend of mine."</p>

<p>Philippe felt like dancing. What a wonderful
thing had happened! He was really going
on a trip. Of course, it was only to Antwerp,
and then for just a few days. But even so,
adventures might happen. Had Philippe
known what adventure was really coming,
he might not have been so happy.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>



<h2>Chapter VII<br />

PHILIPPE RUNS AWAY</h2>


<p>In the morning early a very excited little
boy stood at the door of a farmhouse and
gazed down the road.</p>

<p>Philippe was ready to travel to Antwerp
with his friends, the two gentlemen. They
had promised to stop by for him, and he had
arisen early.</p>

<p>He was now in a state of great excitement.
Mother Yvelle stood by his side. Her face
was sad. She did not like to see her son leaving
her. They heard a sound. The big motor
car was approaching the tiny farm.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, Mamma. I shall be home soon.
Do not worry," said Philippe.</p>

<p>He threw his arms about his mother's neck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
The big car stopped before the door. The
gentlemen jumped out.</p>

<p>"He will be back in two or three days,"
said the Englishman to Mother Yvelle. "We
shall take good care of him. Have no fear."</p>

<p>Bundling Philippe into the car, the two gentlemen
waved cheerily to the Belgian woman.
She stood and watched them as they disappeared
down the road.</p>

<p>"What is that?" cried the American, looking
in surprise at his feet.</p>

<p>The lap robe of the car was moving.</p>

<p>"What can it be?" exclaimed the Englishman.</p>

<p>They lifted the lap robe. There, crouching
on the floor of the car and looking up at them
with friendly eyes, was Philippe's dog,
Trompke.</p>

<p>"Trompke!" cried Philippe, "How did you
get in? Shame!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a><br /><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
<p>The puppy's tail went thump, thump! on
the floor.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry," said Philippe. "I'll take
him back if you'll stop the car."</p>

<p>"Never mind," laughed the Englishman.
"Let him go along. He must have jumped
in while we were saying goodbye to your
mother."</p>

<p>"He would not let me go off without him,"
said Philippe. "He is so used to coming
along."</p>

<p>So Trompke made the fourth traveler.</p>

<p>Along the smooth roads they motored.
They passed tall poplar trees and well-tilled
fields. They passed busy farmers. Everybody
works in Belgium. It is an industrious
little country.</p>

<p>They were soon in Antwerp. It is a short
drive. They found the city less beautiful than
Brussels. It seemed bristling with excitement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a><br /><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>and business. Some of the streets were picturesque
and charming. Others were dirty
and filled with rough people.</p>

<p>Philippe told his friend travelers that the
most interesting place to see was the water
front.</p>

<p>"It was there that the supplies, sent from
your country during the World War, arrived,"
said the boy, looking at his American
companion. "That is the port through which
thousands and thousands of vessels pass each
year."</p>

<p>They drove to the docks. Flags were flying
from ships of almost every nation. There
were miles and miles of masts and funnels.
The air was full of busy noises.</p>

<p>"Did you know," asked the English gentleman,
"that Antwerp is the second most
important shipping port in Europe? Hamburg
alone is more important."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>After they had left the docks, they wandered
about the city on foot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p>They saw the house where the great
painter, Rubens, lived.</p>

<span class="caption">HOME OF RUBENS, ANTWERP</span>
</div>

<p>It was growing late, and they talked of resting
at a hotel before dinner. They were crossing
a noisy street, on their way to a hotel,
when Philippe suddenly saw Zelie and Tom.</p>

<p>The boy stopped. The two gentlemen were
already on the opposite side. But Philippe
stood stock still in the middle of the street
and clutched his fat little puppy until the
dog squealed. He had seen Zelie and Tom!
But only for a moment.</p>

<p>Zelie was pushing the big organ. They had
disappeared from sight, down an alleyway.</p>

<p>Only for a moment did Philippe stand still.
Then he gathered his wits together. Off he
dashed, after Zelie and Tom. But even
though Philippe had followed almost imme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a><br /><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>diately,
they had now completely disappeared.</p>

<p>Thinking that he had been mistaken in the
direction, Philippe turned around quickly
and started down another street. Oh, he must
find Zelie and Tom. He had missed them so.
He wanted to talk with them again.</p>

<p>Frantically he turned, and once more he
ran down the alleyway. There was a group
of children playing on the curb.</p>

<p>"Have you seen a man and a girl with an
organ?" asked Philippe in French.</p>

<p>The children did not understand. They giggled.
Philippe realized that in Antwerp most
of the people speak Flemish. He repeated
his question in that language.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied one of the children. "They
went very fast down that way. They went
past the church toward the station."</p>

<p>Calling back his thanks, Philippe darted off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
in the direction given. Asking questions as
he went, he finally arrived at the railway station.
Puffing and panting, he dashed up to
the station master.</p>

<p>"Have you seen&mdash;a tall man&mdash;and a girl&mdash;with
an organ?" puffed Philippe.</p>

<p>The station master smiled at the wild face
of the boy before him.</p>

<p>Then he pointed to a train just chugging
away and replied, "They are on that train
which is leaving the station."</p>

<p>Philippe's face fell. His heart pounded.</p>

<p>"Where is that train going?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"To Ghent," replied the station master,
smiling. "It is too late to catch it now."</p>

<p>"When does the next train leave for
Ghent?" asked Philippe.</p>

<p>"There is no train for Ghent tonight&mdash;only
a freight train which leaves here in an hour,"
the man answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy thanked the station master and
turned away quickly. Philippe knew that he
would not be allowed to ride on the freight
train. But he also knew that he was going to
follow his friends to Ghent if he had to
board the train secretly and hide.</p>

<p>And that is just what he did. A wild idea
had come into his head. Why should he go
back to Brussels with the two gentlemen?
Why should he begin all over again that dull
life in the market place? Why not run away
and join Tom and Zelie? They were not far.
They were in Ghent. Yes, Philippe would
go to Ghent.</p>

<p>So, huddled between boxes and crates, the
boy and his puppy sat still in the stuffy
freight car and waited for it to leave the station.
Finally it pulled out, and Philippe knew
that he was on his way to Ghent and to his
friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he began to think of the thing he
had done. What would the two foreign gentlemen
think? What would his father and
mother do when the gentlemen returned to
Brussels without their boy?</p>

<p>Philippe smiled to himself as he thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
"I shall write to them. They will be pleased
when I send them great sums of money."</p>

<p>Poor Philippe! Little did he know what
awaited him! Little did he dream that much
trouble lay between himself and his return
home.</p>

<p>He only knew that at last he was off on his
adventure. Young Philippe was now going
forth into the world like a knight of old. But
instead of riding a steed, this knight sat huddled
in an old freight car with a fat puppy in
his arms.</p>

<h2>Chapter VIII<br />

A DIFFICULT JOURNEY</h2>


<p>Belgium has more miles of railway than
any other country of its size in the world.</p>

<p>Philippe was having a noisy ride, huddled
up in the corner of a freight car. He was tired
out from all the excitement of travel during
the day. Even the sounds of passing trains,
the swaying motion, the puff-puffing and
shrill whistling all around him could not keep
him awake. Philippe and Trompke slept.</p>

<p>Philippe did not know how long he had
been sleeping when he suddenly sat up
straight. The train had stopped. The boy
rubbed his eyes. All was black around him.
He could feel the soft coat of Trompke beside
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>He felt for the door of the car and opened
it. Then he jumped out, followed by Trompke.
He found himself standing beside the
freight car. It was night. They were in the
middle of a field, far out in the country. The
rest of the train had, no doubt, gone off and
left them behind.</p>

<p>He was alone. Probably the rest of the
freight train was now in Ghent. But his car
had been left in this deserted place for some
reason which Philippe did not know.</p>

<p>He started across the field toward a farmhouse.
He was very hungry! If only he might
go in and ask for something to eat. But it
was very late at night. The people were surely
asleep, and he must not awaken them.</p>

<p>There was a barn near the house. Philippe
decided to sleep there. He could go to the
house in the morning and ask for food. So
he climbed up into a hay loft. The hay was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
soft and sweet; snuggling down, the boy and
the dog were soon asleep. It must have been
nearly dawn, when Philippe was awakened
by voices below him. Not stirring, he listened.
He heard two men, who had entered
and were unharnessing a horse.<br /></p>

<span class="caption">PHILIPPE SLEPT IN THE HAY</span>
</div>

<p>"It was the best fair of the year," said one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">CANAL AND SHEEP, A VIEW OF BELGIAN COUNTRYSIDE</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>In Belgium there are many fairs all the
year round.</p>

<p>"Ah, ho, hum!" yawned the other man.
"But we stayed in Ghent so long! Now we
shall have only a short time to sleep before
starting the day's work."</p>

<p>"Never mind," the other man declared, "it
was worth the drive. And besides, the fair is
leaving Ghent tomorrow."</p>

<p>Philippe put his chin on his elbow and listened.
Then the man began to sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"I wouldn't be a lettuce<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With my head all thrown about."<br /></span></div></div>

<p>"That was the song that the gypsy girl
sang; wasn't it?" asked the other.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the first.</p>

<p>Philippe could hardly believe what he
heard. That was his song! He had taught that
song to Rose! Zelie must be singing his
songs at the fair in Ghent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Philippe was about to call down to the men.
Then he stopped. They might mistake him
for a tramp. They might do him some harm.
No; he must be careful.</p>

<p>Then, yawning sleepily, the two men
stamped out of the barn. Philippe heard the
door closing behind them.</p>

<p>The only sound now was the crunch-crunching
of the horse. But even that did not
remind Philippe of his hunger. He could
think of only one thing. He must reach
Ghent as quickly as possible! He must find
his friends before they left. He must join
them at the fair in Ghent.</p>

<p>Philippe rose and went down into the barn.
The men had locked the door; but there was
a tiny window above the horse's stall.
Through this, the boy first pushed Trompke.
Then he started to climb through it himself.</p>

<p>"Come, Trompke," he called. "We must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
walk to Ghent. There is no time to lose. We
must get there before the fair moves on."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus115.jpg" width="600" height="505" alt="HE STARTED THROUGH THE WINDOW" />
<span class="caption">HE STARTED THROUGH THE WINDOW</span>
</div>

<p>Dawn was in the sky as the boy and his dog
trudged wearily along the road. They were
in the famous flax-growing district of Belgium.
There were many glistening canals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and rows of tall trees. They crossed bridges
and passed low farmhouses with red roofs.
But not once did Philippe stop.</p>

<p>Though his legs ached, never once did the
boy give in. Trompke's tongue swept the
ground. He was too tired to bark even at
birds and chickens.</p>

<p>They passed fields of flax. This flax is sent
to the factories of Ghent where it is made
into fine linen.</p>

<p>The word "Ghent" is taken from the
French word "gant," meaning "glove."
Ghent was once famous for glove making.
But today the lace and linen trades are more
popular.</p>

<p>At last Philippe could see the outline of
houses in the distance. It was bright sunlight
now. There was smoke curling up from
chimneys. People were cooking breakfast in
Ghent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">HARVESTING GRAIN BY HAND IN BELGIUM</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Philippe could not let himself think of
that. To the market place he went.</p>

<p>"Where is the fair?" he asked a passerby.</p>

<p>"It left Ghent last night," was the answer.
"It will be in Bruges (brōō'jez) for three
days, and I only wish I could go there and
see it again."</p>

<p>Philippe did not hear the last remark. He
had already turned. Everything had begun to
whirl about him. But he stumbled on, on.</p>

<p>"We must follow them to Bruges, Trompke,"
he said, bravely.</p>

<p>But Trompke lay down on the sidewalk
with his head between his paws. His tongue
was lolling. His eyes said, "Not I! I stay!"</p>

<p>But Philippe was already walking away.
Trompke arose wearily and followed. What
dog has the right to refuse the commands
of a boy? It is true that in this case the dog
was more sensible than the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>For Philippe was completely worn out. He
was so tired and hungry, he could scarcely
think. It would have been better had he
rested awhile.</p>

<p>But all he could think of was finding Tom
and Zelie and joining them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter IX<br />

THE CITY OF SISTERS</h2>


<p>Philippe approached the great Convent of
Ghent. This convent is different from most
convents. It is like a little village where each
sister has her own cosy house. These
sisters have given up the life of the world.
They live their own lives in this City of Sisters.
They spend their time making beautiful
laces, doing charity work and going to
church.</p>

<p>Philippe had heard of the convent in Ghent.
He had seen some of the sisters in Brussels
at times. He knew they were kind and he
determined to enter one of their homes and
ask for food.</p>

<p>At the gate of the convent, Philippe met an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
elderly sister. She wore a long black gown
and a snow-white cap. Her face was ruddy
and wrinkled. She smiled at Philippe and
stopped.</p>

<p>"You look tired, little one," she said.</p>

<p>Philippe answered, "I have walked many
miles. I am hungry."</p>

<p>The sister then led him into her wee house.
It looked like a gingerbread house. It was
like all the other houses at the convent. It
was made of brick.</p>

<p>"Come, let me give you some broth," said
the sister kindly.</p>

<p>And she gave Philippe a bowl of delicious
broth. They sat together in her neat little
room.</p>

<p>When Philippe finished the broth he said,
"Thank you, my sister. You are very kind."
Then he told her his story.</p>

<p>"I must go on to Bruges," he finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
"For the fair is in Bruges, and I shall find my
friends there."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus122.jpg" width="600" height="464" alt="THE GREAT CONVENT OF GHENT" />
<span class="caption">THE GREAT CONVENT OF GHENT</span>
</div>

<p>The sister looked serious.</p>

<p>"My boy, does your mother know what
you are doing?" she asked.</p>

<p>Philippe shook his head slowly and said,
"But I shall write to her now if you will
please give me a pen and some paper."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>After he had written to his parents, the
boy looked up and found the good sister's
gaze upon him.</p>

<p>"Why don't you give up this idea and go
home?" she asked.</p>

<p>But Philippe laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he replied, "I could not do that
now. Why, Tom says I shall make great
sums of money! Tom is a fine fellow! Oh,
my parents will be glad that I went, when I
make them rich."</p>

<p>But still the sister seemed worried.</p>

<p>"Stay with me a day or so," she urged.
"You are worn out with your long walk. Let
me give you rest and food. Then perhaps we
may find a way to send you to Bruges."</p>

<p>Philippe patted her rough, capable hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my sister," he said, "but I
must waste no time."</p>

<p>Then the sister arose and went to a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
table. She took from a drawer a linen bag.
From the bag she brought forth some money.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus124.jpg" width="600" height="468" alt="SISTERS OF THE CONVENT" />
<span class="caption">SISTERS OF THE CONVENT</span>
</div>

<p>Handing it to Philippe, she said, "Take
this, little one, and ride to Bruges on it. That
way you will reach your friends quickly and
save your strength."</p>

<p>Philippe hesitated at first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he took the money and said, "I can
never thank you enough. But I shall return
this money to you. You shall see."</p>

<p>After Philippe had washed and prepared to
leave, he said to his new friend, "I have
heard so much about the fine lace which is
made by the sisters of the convent. May I see
some of it?"</p>

<p>The good woman smiled and led the boy
to another room to show him her work.</p>

<p>But suddenly Philippe started and looked
about him with troubled eyes.</p>

<p>"My sister!" he cried, "I had a little dog.
I almost forgot about him!"</p>

<p>"I saw your little dog," the sister answered.
"He came in with you. But now he has disappeared."</p>

<p>Philippe began calling, "Trompke! Trompke!"</p>

<p>The sister helped him search the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot imagine where he went," exclaimed
the sister.</p>

<p>Then they saw a strange sight.</p>

<p>From the big workbasket, where the sister
kept her lace, came Trompke. He was completely
wrapped in beautiful lace. He looked
like a bride. His train was long and flowing.
Upon his head was a lace cap. His dog face
peered forth anxiously.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus128.jpg" width="600" height="634" alt="HIS DOG FACE PEERED FORTH ANXIOUSLY" />
<span class="caption">HIS DOG FACE PEERED FORTH ANXIOUSLY</span>
</div>

<p>His tail stirred the lace train as it wagged,
as if it were asking, "Were you looking for
me?" For, you know, dogs speak with their
tails.</p>

<p>Trompke waddled up to Philippe and continued
to talk in tail language as if he were
saying, "I was fast asleep in the workbasket.
I was very tired. The lace was soft."</p>

<p>As soon as Philippe recovered from his
amazement, he fell on his knees and began
to untangle the lace from the dog's body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Trompke! Shame, Trompke!" he cried.</p>

<p>But the sister was laughing so hard that her
kind, red face grew even redder than usual.</p>

<p>"Do not scold him," she said, "He did no
harm. Oh, what a funny sight!"</p>

<p>And again the good sister went into peals
of laughter. Her mirth started Philippe to
thinking. A plan was forming in his mind.</p>

<p>Suddenly he jumped to his feet and exclaimed,
"My sister, I have thought of a
plan!"</p>

<p>The sister wiped the tears of laughter from
her eyes. She listened to the boy.</p>

<p>"It suddenly came to me as you were laughing,"
he said, "that if the sight of Trompke
seemed so funny to you, why would it not be
funny to others?"</p>

<p>The sister gave signs of exploding again at
the mention of lace-gowned Trompke.</p>

<p>But Philippe went on, "Give me some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
your lace. I will dress Trompke as a bride
in the market place of Bruges. People will
stop. And when they stop, I shall sell them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
your lace. I shall be able, then, to repay
you."</p>

<p>The sister looked into Philippe's eyes. She
seemed much interested in what he had said.</p>

<p>She replied, "You have thought of a very
clever plan. You are one who will make
much of your life. That is plain to see."</p>

<p>Without wasting any time, the sister and
Philippe prepared for the boy's journey.</p>

<p>Soon Philippe was leaving the tiny house
with a bundle of lace tucked under his arm.
His good friend walked with him as far as
the gates of the convent.</p>

<p>As Philippe looked back, he saw the sister
standing at the big iron gates, waving to him.</p>

<p>She looked after him and thought, "What
a clever little fellow he is!"</p>

<p>She did not know what a disobedient little
fellow Philippe really was. Also, she did not
know that she was sending him to a thief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
But then, neither did Philippe know this.
He had told her that Tom and Zelie were his
friends and that they were fine people. Philippe
honestly believed this.</p>

<p>As he walked, he turned every little while
to wave back to the sister. At last the City
of Sisters faded from sight.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter X<br />

IN THE SHADOWS OF BRUGES</h2>


<p>Philippe traveled comfortably to Bruges.
Thanks to his friend, the sister, he rode in a
train. He left the glass-roofed station of
Ghent, and soon the train was speeding
through flat, fertile country. It was not long
before the old city of Bruges loomed into
sight.</p>

<p>The word "Bruges" means "Bridges," and
it is no wonder that the city bears that name.
For everywhere one looks, one sees a bridge.</p>

<p>Bruges is a very old city. Once, long years
ago, it was a famous port. Fabrics of many
kinds came into Bruges. Famous Belgian
laces and linens were shipped from there to
other countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus132.jpg" width="600" height="437" alt="ANCIENT CITY GATE, BRUGES" />
<span class="caption">ANCIENT CITY GATE, BRUGES</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>But since the discovery of America, Bruges
has been very quiet. For with the discovery
of the new world came a great change. There
came new methods of trading. Bruges sank
back upon her bridges and let the rest of the
world go by.</p>

<p>Philippe sat in his railway coach. He
looked out of the window and thought how
very gray and dull the old city looked.</p>

<p>"I should not like to be alone on those old
cobbled streets at night," he shivered.</p>

<p>The tall steeples of the old churches threw
shadows. Ghosts of knights in armor might
well prowl those streets! Again Philippe
shuddered.</p>

<p>He began to be a little homesick. He began
to think about his mother and Papa Pomme
and Baby Rose. He had disobeyed his parents.
He had left those two kind gentlemen
without saying a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>What would they think of him? Philippe
knew that he had done wrong. But
somehow he knew that he was going
to keep right on until he found
Tom and Zelie. He could not give up
now.</p>

<p>The train pulled into the station and
stopped. The boy started out in search of
the fair. To the market place he went.
Crowds were there. It was a gay sight.
Booths were everywhere. There were merry-go-rounds
and swinging boats and shooting
galleries and candy stands.</p>

<p>Children were all about, laughing, singing,
eating. Philippe's eye was trained, and he
knew market places. He had spent most of
his life in one. So he found a spot for himself
and began to dress the dog, Trompke.</p>

<p>Trompke disapproved. But Philippe won
the battle, and soon the dog was dressed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
lace cap and veil. His worried, wrinkled face
looked out from under the dainty lace cap.
His tail wiggled the handsome lacy train.</p>

<p>Philippe sang to attract the crowds and
soon people began to stop and to laugh at
Trompke. All the time Philippe was looking
about him, while his heart beat fast.</p>

<p>Perhaps a few feet away from him were his
friends. He hoped that he would find them.
Perhaps Zelie had sung to the same people
who were now laughing at Trompke.</p>

<p>The boy examined every booth. But there
was no sign of Tom or Zelie.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sister's lace was selling fast.
People stopped to laugh and to pet Trompke.
The little boy explained to them about the
lace.</p>

<p>"The finest lace in all the world, madam,"
said he, "made by the sisters in Ghent. A
very excellent bargain."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Philippe sold all his lace and found his
pockets bulging with money. How pleased
the good sister would be!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">HE DRESSED TROMPKE AS A BRIDE</span>
</div>

<p>Besides, he had made extra money for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>self.
People gave him extra money because
they liked his sweet voice and because
Trompke made them laugh.</p>

<p>But the heart of Philippe was heavy. He
had not seen Tom and Zelie! He was in a
strange city; he was far from home, and it
was growing late.</p>

<p>Philippe now walked slowly to the post
office. Here he sent away two letters. One
was to his father.</p>

<p>He told his father not to worry about him.
He said that he could not return to Brussels
because he was going to make his way and
send them a great deal of money. He enclosed
some bills in the envelope, and he felt
proud.</p>

<p>The other letter was to the sister and contained
the money in payment for the laces
and also payment of the amount the sister
had loaned him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>He still had money in his pocket. He
bought food. But Trompke ate most of it.
Somehow Philippe did not feel hungry. He
was too excited.</p>

<h2>Chapter XI<br />

FOUND</h2>


<p>The shadows were falling in Bruges. The
high towers were reflected in the canals. The
city was slowly being covered by night.</p>

<p>A terrible, lonesome feeling came over Philippe
as he watched the darkness stealing on.
How could he stay all night in the ghostly
darkness of this old city? His teeth began to
chatter.</p>

<p>A boy about his own age came up to him.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Philippe truthfully.</p>

<p>"You don't know?" the boy laughed. "Then
let me take you somewhere. Have you some
money?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Philippe showed the stranger his money.</p>

<p>"We can go to the cinema," smiled the boy
eagerly.</p>

<p>So Philippe was taken to a theater by his
new companion. Philippe was tired and discouraged
and sank down in his seat with a
sigh. He wanted to go home.</p>

<p>He was afraid of the dark city and the
strange shadows. He knew he had done
wrong. Now he was ready to give up.</p>

<p>But as he watched the flickering shadow
people on the screen, he thought of that other
film which he had seen with his father. He
remembered the brave Belgian soldiers and
the heroic King Albert. Then he had wanted
to be a hero, too. But now he was acting like
a coward.</p>

<p>This film story was a romance with knights
on fiery steeds. What adventure those brave
knights had! They did not give up and go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
home. They came home in glory and each
married a princess!</p>

<p>Philippe sat up straight. He saw himself
as one of those knights. Then he turned suddenly
to the boy next to him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus143.jpg" width="600" height="501" alt="HE SAW HIMSELF AS A KNIGHT" />
<span class="caption">HE SAW HIMSELF AS A KNIGHT</span>
</div>

<p>"Did you see a man and a girl with an
organ today at the fair?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the boy at his side, "They
were at the fair, and the girl sang."</p>

<p>"Did you notice which way they went when
they left the market place?" Philippe demanded
quickly.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" hesitated the other, "I did see
them going down&mdash;Oh, don't bother me now.
I want to see the film," he added irritably.</p>

<p>But Philippe had him by the shoulders.</p>

<p>"Come out of here," he ordered.</p>

<p>The boy was too amazed to refuse. Together
the two marched out of the theater.</p>

<p>On the sidewalk Philippe seized the boy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
arm and said to him, "I must find those people.
Do you understand? Now, you've got
to think which way you saw them go!"</p>

<p>After Philippe had told his story and explained
about Tom and Zelie, the other boy
remarked, "Well, my friends and I followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the organ man to a narrow little street where
the poorest people live. The place was very
dark, even in the daytime. It frightened some
of the little children; so we left. We did not
stay to see where the organ man went."</p>

<p>Philippe thanked his new acquaintance,
and the boy was glad to go back to his seat
in the theater.</p>

<p>Philippe followed directions, and soon he
was in the dingy little street in which Tom
and Zelie had disappeared.</p>

<p>No one was about. It was the blackest,
most silent place Philippe had ever been in.
He and his dog huddled beside a wall. There
was nobody whom he could ask for information.
Had he the courage to ring a doorbell?</p>

<p>He started toward a door. His finger was
about to push the bell when a voice called to
him. The voice came from above.</p>

<p>Philippe looked up, and there was Tom!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a><br /><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<p>He was looking out of a window. It was so
dark that Philippe could not see Tom's face
very clearly. But his voice was cheery.</p>

<p>"Hello, my lad," he called. "So you've
come to us at last!"</p>

<p>Philippe ran up the steps, and Tom let him
into the house. It was a poor house and
smelled musty and old.</p>

<p>Tom was very pleased to see the boy.</p>

<p>"I knew that some day you would come,"
he said, slapping Philippe on the back. "You
are a fine brave lad, and we shall have a
splendid life together, wandering on the
road."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus145.jpg" width="600" height="675" alt="&quot;YOU ARE A FINE, BRAVE LAD&quot;" />
<span class="caption">"YOU ARE A FINE, BRAVE LAD"</span>
</div>

<p>"Where is Zelie?" asked Philippe.</p>

<p>"Ah, she will soon be home. She is so busy.
She works very late sometimes," answered
Tom smiling.</p>

<p>"What does she do?" Philippe asked after
a little silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"She plays the organ, and she sings," the
man replied. "Now, you shall join her, and
together you two should bring in much
money."</p>

<p>His eyes gleamed. Philippe did not feel
very happy. But he could not tell why. Perhaps
he was just tired, and tomorrow all
would be well.</p>

<p>Then suddenly from the street below, there
came a howl. Philippe ran to the window
and saw his dog, Trompke, below. The fat
puppy was whimpering and calling his master.
He had been forgotten outside.</p>

<p>Philippe smiled at Tom.</p>

<p>"That is my Trompke," he said.</p>

<p>They opened the door, and the puppy flew
up the steps into Philippe's arms. Philippe
stroked him, and then he told Tom how
Trompke had helped him to sell the sister's
lace. Tom was delighted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a bright boy you are!" he exclaimed.
"You shall continue selling lace for me. That
is a splendid plan."</p>

<p>Just then Zelie came home. She seemed
thinner and paler than when Philippe had
last seen her. She did not talk very much,
but her face lit up when she saw Philippe.</p>

<p>"I am so glad you have come," she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
"We shall have such good times together."</p>

<p>Tom grinned broadly.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," he agreed. "There is a fair
in Ostend (ŏst-ĕnd'), so we four shall start
our wanderings tomorrow."</p>

<p>"We four?" asked Zelie.</p>

<p>She had not noticed Trompke. The puppy
was curled up behind a chair.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus148.jpg" width="600" height="402" alt="&quot;WE FOUR SHALL START OUR WANDERINGS TOMORROW&quot;" />
<span class="caption">"WE FOUR SHALL START OUR WANDERINGS TOMORROW"</span>
</div>

<p>"Yes," smiled Tom slyly. "The little dog
is to be one of our party, and a very important
one, too. Eh, Philippe, my boy?"</p>

<p>Philippe smiled and began to feel happier.
At last he was going to do the thing he had
always dreamed of doing. At last he was
going to travel with Tom and Zelie.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XII<br />

PHILIPPE FINDS OUT</h2>


<p>So Tom went out next day and purchased
some lace at a very cheap price. He and the
two children packed their things, and started
on their journey.</p>

<p>Philippe's plan succeeded, and Tom was
delighted with the way the lace-gowned dog
drew the crowds. Philippe and Zelie sang together,
and people thought the two children
very attractive. They brought in much
money for Tom.</p>

<p>From town to town they traveled.</p>

<p>Tom always seemed gay and pleasant. The
only times he ever showed his ill nature was
when the children did not bring in enough
money. Then his scowls were very disagree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>able
to see. But usually he was pleased with
what Philippe and Zelie and Trompke made.</p>

<p>They arrived at the fair in Ostend, a famous
beach resort of Belgium. They attracted the
attention of many children along the wide
beach. Here they saw hundreds of bathing
machines.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus152.jpg" width="600" height="469" alt="BATHING BEACH AT OSTEND" />
<span class="caption">BATHING BEACH AT OSTEND</span>
</div>

<p>These machines are little houses on wheels,
in which people dress and undress. Horses
are hitched to the houses. They pull them
to the water's edge, where the bathers jump
into the sea for their swim.</p>

<p>From Ostend they journeyed to Courtrai
(kōō-trĕ') and the flax fields.</p>

<p>Philippe noticed how much the Belgian
people living near the border of France resemble
the French people.</p>

<p>In sections of Belgium close to Holland, the
people wear wooden shoes and look very
Dutch. Their language, Flemish, is indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a><br /><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
almost the same as the Dutch language.</p>

<p>As they wandered through the Belgian villages
the smell of cows and fresh hay greeted
their nostrils.</p>

<p>Nearly everyone is poor in these villages.
The women wear bedroom slippers in the
street.</p>

<p>They now came to Tournai (toor-nĕ'),
which is one of the most ancient towns in
Belgium. It dates from the time of Julius
Caesar.</p>

<p>As they approached the city of Mons,
(môns) they passed great coal mines. These
mines were taken over by the Germans during
the World War.</p>

<p>While armies were fighting in France and
destroying French property, Belgian farms
and factories were being well run by the Germans.
That is why our travelers, wandering
over the country of Belgium, saw few ruins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>They trudged along black roads and
passed great chimney stacks.</p>

<p>Several times Philippe had sent money
home to his parents.</p>

<p>But one day Tom said, "I must ask you
to give me all the money you make. It is I
who feed and clothe you. And now you belong
to me."</p>

<p>Philippe had a strange feeling then.</p>

<p>He answered, "But I must send my parents
some of what I make. It is only fair."</p>

<p>Tom scowled fearfully and snapped, "You
will do as I say!"</p>

<p>After that time Philippe worried. He told
Zelie, but she said nothing. She looked very
sad, however.</p>

<p>Then one evening while they were having
supper by the side of the road, Tom announced,
"It is time that Philippe learned
our business, eh, Zelie?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Zelie started and turned very pale, but she
did not answer.</p>

<p>"Listen," continued Tom. He leaned over
toward Philippe. "Do you see that farm over
there?"</p>

<p>He pointed to a little peaceful-looking farm
in the distance. Philippe nodded. He wondered
what Tom was going to say. Tom had
never talked like this before.</p>

<p>"Tonight we shall go to that farm," Tom
went on, "and we shall take a wheelbarrow
along, and we shall help ourselves to all the
fine vegetables there. Tomorrow we shall set
up in the market place. You have sold vegetables
in market places before, eh, my Philippe?"</p>

<p>But the boy could not answer. He was
horrified.</p>

<p>It all came to him then. This was the vegetable
thief&mdash;the man who had stolen his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
father's vegetables! Tom! Oh, what a foolish
boy he had been! Why hadn't he listened
to his parents? He was traveling with a thief!</p>

<p>Tom said in an irritable voice, "Come on,
boy! Don't stare at me like that! Wake up,
and we shall teach you!"</p>

<p>But Philippe had jumped up quickly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
stood before Tom. His fists were clenched
and his cheeks burned.</p>

<p>"No, no! I won't steal," he cried. "It is
wicked to steal! I will not help you!"</p>

<p>Tom only smiled calmly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus156.jpg" width="600" height="485" alt="&quot;NO, NO! I WON'T STEAL!&quot;" />
<span class="caption">"NO, NO! I WON'T STEAL!"</span>
</div>

<p>Then he said, "Oh, very well, my boy. Do
not excite yourself. You need not come
along, since you feel that way. Zelie and I
have always done well. We can still get
along without you. You shall do your work by
singing, and we by stealing. That is simple."</p>

<p>But Philippe was angry.</p>

<p>"Oh, you wicked man!" he cried. "I will
not stay with you any longer. I am going
home!"</p>

<p>Then Tom caught hold of the boy's arm.
Tom's eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"No!" he said firmly, "No. You had better
not try that. You are mine, and you shall
stay with me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>That night Tom locked Philippe in the
room of a little hotel while he and Zelie went
to the farm.</p>

<p>Philippe wrote a letter to his father. He
told all of what had happened. He begged
forgiveness and asked his father to come and
get him.</p>

<p>But when Tom returned, he found the letter
and burned it.</p>

<p>"Do not try any tricks," he said, "for you
will be sorry."</p>

<p>He yawned sleepily and went to bed.</p>

<p>When Philippe heard Tom's snores, he
tried to run away. But Zelie stopped him
at the door.</p>

<p>"Don't go," she said. "Please don't go.
He will find you, and then he will beat you."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Philippe.</p>

<p>"Because," Zelie replied, "he has done it
to me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>And then Philippe knew why Zelie's eyes
were so sad and held a look of fear.</p>

<p>"Oh, Zelie," Philippe cried, "I am so sorry
for you. You are so brave."</p>

<p>Zelie then began to cry softly.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I am very sad," she sobbed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
"That is why I was so glad to see you. Before
you came, oh, he made me work so
hard!"</p>

<p>"Do not cry, Zelie," said Philippe, "but
tell me all about it. I will protect you."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus159.jpg" width="600" height="528" alt="&quot;DO NOT CRY, ZELIE&quot;" />
<span class="caption">"DO NOT CRY, ZELIE"</span>
</div>

<p>Philippe suddenly felt very brave. He felt
like one of those knights he had seen in the
film. He felt like a hero out of a fairy tale.
He knew that he was only a boy, but he had
great courage, and he wanted to protect Zelie.</p>

<p>"We two will escape," he promised the
girl. "You'll see. Now tell me everything."</p>

<p>Then Zelie told Philippe that Tom was not
really her father.</p>

<p>"My mother and father died when I was a
baby," she told him, "and this man is my
uncle. Oh, he is a very bad man, and he has
made me steal, and if he ever should catch
us trying to escape&mdash;oh, oh!"</p>

<p>The poor little girl again began to sob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stop, Zelie," urged Philippe. "I have a
plan, and we will escape."</p>

<p>Zelie dried her eyes. Then she went to her
room, and Philippe started to think.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XIII<br />

THE CAVE OF THE CROWS</h2>


<p>Philippe tried several times after that to
post a letter. But Tom's eyes were very keen,
and he seemed to see everything at once.</p>

<p>Ever since that day, Tom had watched
Philippe all the time. But the man acted no
differently than before. He whistled a great
deal and was pleased with the money that
the children brought in.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus163.jpg" width="600" height="474" alt="HE WHISTLED A GREAT DEAL" />
<span class="caption">HE WHISTLED A GREAT DEAL</span>
</div>

<p>Still he worked them harder than ever.
Often Philippe's legs ached with standing so
long. Often his throat was sore with singing.</p>

<p>He knew that he was being punished for
his disobedience. He knew that if he ever
escaped from this wicked man he would always
obey his parents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom often joked with Philippe, and the
boy told him stories about the country
through which they traveled. But all the
while, Tom did not know what plans were
shaping in Philippe's head.</p>

<p>One day as they tramped along, Philippe
carried a letter in his pocket. The letter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
to Papa Pomme. Philippe was planning to
post the letter when they reached Charleroi
(shär-le-roi'), in the evening.</p>

<p>In it he told Papa Pomme everything. But
he told him not to worry, that he was well,
and also that he was laying a plan to capture
the thief.</p>

<p>Part of Philippe's letter read: "I shall try
to make him spend Monday night in the
Cave of the Crows. That is the big rock between
Namur (nâ-mür') and Dinant (dē-nän').
Send some one to that place, for if
my plan succeeds we shall be there."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 466px;">
<img src="images/illus165.jpg" width="466" height="600" alt="ON THE ROAD TO DINANT" />
<span class="caption">ON THE ROAD TO DINANT</span>
</div>

<p>The Cave of the Crows is a mysterious rock
out on the open road. There is a folk tale
connected with it, and part of Philippe's plan
was to tell this tale to Tom.</p>

<p>As they walked along, the boy kept thinking
over his plan.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus167.jpg" width="600" height="465" alt="A VIEW IN DINANT, A VERY OLD CITY" />
<span class="caption">A VIEW IN DINANT, A VERY OLD CITY</span>
</div>

<p>"If only I can persuade him to spend Mon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a><br /><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>day
night there!" Philippe mused earnestly.</p>

<p>They reached Charleroi, after passing the
country of the iron workers.</p>

<p>Philippe found this part of the country different
from that around Antwerp and Brussels.
To him even the people seemed different.
Here he found pine and birch trees and
little stone houses.</p>

<p>Most of the people in northern Belgium are
blond and large. Here they are dark and
smaller and more lively.</p>

<p>Once in Charleroi, Philippe explained to
Zelie what he wanted her to do. Zelie agreed
to follow out the plan, and Philippe gave her
the letter.</p>

<p>Then Philippe started to run down the
street.</p>

<p>Zelie cried out to Tom, "Look! Quick! Philippe
is running away!"</p>

<p>Tom was after the boy in a second, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a><br /><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Zelie quickly slipped Philippe's letter to Papa
Pomme into the mail box.</p>

<p>But poor Philippe had to pay for this trick.
Tom locked him up all day and gave him
only bread and water.</p>

<p>Yet the boy's heart leaped with joy. Now
the letter was off. It only remained for him
to persuade Tom to spend the night in the
cave.</p>

<p>It was pleasant country through which they
were passing. Along the banks of the Sambre
(sän'-br) River, they saw many women
washing clothes. Men on barges waved and
called to them. These men seemed a happy
lot. Old castles loomed up.</p>

<p>Monday arrived. The three travelers were
nearing the Cave of the Crows.</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard the story of the Cave
of the Crows, sir?" asked Philippe.</p>

<p>"No," replied Tom. "Tell it to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>He liked Philippe's stories. The little fellow
had entertained him with many.</p>

<p>"They say," began Philippe, "that long,
long years ago a wandering poet passed this
cave, and there he met a beautiful fairy. He
fell in love with her and she with him. They
married and lived in the cave together.</p>

<p>"But one day the fairy was called to a gathering
in fairyland. The other fairies were
angry to learn that she had married a mortal.
As a punishment the poor fairy was changed
into an ugly black crow with a hoarse, terrible
voice.</p>

<p>"She returned to the cave to her poet and
found him also changed into a crow. But
this did not spoil their love for each other.
They lived happily in the cave for years and
years, and they had many children. There
are thousands of black crows flying about the
cave, shrieking and cawing. These are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
descendants of the poet and the poor fairy."</p>

<p>Tom shuddered.</p>

<p>"A very good place from which to keep
away!" he laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied Philippe. "On the contrary,
I should like to go there. I should like
to go," he added mysteriously, "because it is
said that whoever spends a night in the cave
will find a bag of gold in the morning."</p>

<p>Tom's eyes sparkled. Philippe's heart beat
quickly.</p>

<p>He continued, "Yes, it is believed that robbers
once buried a bag of gold in the cave.
Anyone who is brave enough to spend a
night there may have it."</p>

<p>Tom smiled, but looked doubtful.</p>

<p>"Let us go there, sir," suggested Philippe.
"In the morning you shall find that bag of
gold."</p>

<p>Tom thought awhile but did not reply. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
boy nearly cried out in eagerness. Oh, if
only the man would consent to do this thing!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus171.jpg" width="600" height="505" alt="&quot;ROBBERS ONCE BURIED A BAG OF GOLD IN THE CAVE&quot;" />
<span class="caption">"ROBBERS ONCE BURIED A BAG OF GOLD IN THE CAVE"</span>
</div>

<p>The letter he had written to his father
would reach Brussels today. His father
would send some one to the cave tonight.
Then he and Zelie would be free, and Tom
captured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>What had Papa Pomme said? Oh, yes!
The thief must go to prison!</p>

<p>Suddenly Tom spoke. "No," he said. "I
think we shall move on. It might be dangerous
to stay in that cave."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Philippe. "Are you afraid of
the crying of crows?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the man, "It is not that. I
prefer to spend my nights in cities."</p>

<p>Philippe's heart sank.</p>

<p>"But, sir," he said, "would you let such a
chance of gaining wealth escape you? They
say that the bag of gold is very large indeed!"</p>

<p>"Then why is it that no one has ever found
it before?" asked Tom suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Because," answered Philippe, "there is no
one with courage enough. One must be brave
to spend a night in such a cold, dark place
with howling birds all about. That requires
courage like yours, sir!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>The man was pleased with the boy's flattery.</p>

<p>"Do you really think that the bag of gold
is worth the trouble?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Worth it!" exclaimed Philippe. "Why,
sir, it will make you rich!"</p>

<p>Now, Tom, like most wicked men, was ignorant.
He had never gone to school and
he could not even read. Though he was
sharp and quick, he had no learning and he
was not very shrewd. He believed the boy's
story.</p>

<p>Philippe had seemed to know a great deal
about the country. The lad had told many
true stories. He had shown his knowledge
on any number of occasions. Besides, Tom
was so greedy that he could not bear to let
a chance like this go by.</p>

<p>Of course, Tom knew that this was only a
belief. But then, there had been robbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
everywhere at one time, and they might
easily have buried their treasure in this mysterious
cave.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, "we shall spend the
night in the Cave of the Crows!"</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV<br />

TROMPKE TALKS</h2>


<p>It was a weird place to which Philippe led
his little party. Crows, descendants of the
poet and the fairy, flew all about. The noise
they made was deafening.</p>

<p>Philippe was in a state of great excitement;
and the screeching and yelling of the thousands
of birds made his head whirl.</p>

<p>As night came, however, the crows grew
quieter. The little group settled itself to rest.</p>

<p>The man said, "This is your doing, boy.
If there is no bag of gold in the morning I
shall make your head feel like a bag of gold!"</p>

<p>He smiled, but Philippe saw a wicked
gleam in his eye.</p>

<p>They were all tired, and soon Tom fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
asleep; but not Philippe and Zelie! The boy
and girl lay awake and stared into the darkness.
They listened. They waited.</p>

<p>Now, if only some one would come! This
was their one chance to capture Tom and to
free themselves. The night wore on. But no
one came.</p>

<p>Philippe could stand it no longer. What if
Papa Pomme had not received his letter?</p>

<p>The boy stirred slowly and sat up. Suppose
morning came and no one arrived? Tom
would not find a bag of gold, and he would
surely beat poor Philippe for deceiving him.</p>

<p>No, he could not take that chance. There
was only one thing to do. He must try to
escape with Zelie now.</p>

<p>Philippe stole softly to his little friend's
side.</p>

<p>"Quiet, quiet, Zelie! Not a sound! Come
with me," he whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Softly, silently they tiptoed toward the entrance
of the cave.<br /></p>

</div>

<p>But Philippe had forgotten one thing. He
had forgotten Trompke. And Trompke was
not to be forgotten! The little dog lay chained
to a rock.</p>

<p>Tom always took care to keep him tied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Trompke was an important member of that
little group.</p>

<p>As the boy and girl neared the door,
Trompke awoke. Dogs do not sleep as
soundly as people. Trompke's brow wrinkled.
He cocked his puzzled head on one
side. His tail began to speak.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, my little master?"
asked Trompke's tail.</p>

<p>But the children were at the door. They
did not hear the tail language.</p>

<p>So Trompke had to use his mouth. He
barked. He barked again.</p>

<p>Philippe clutched Zelie's hand and ran out
of the cave.</p>

<span class="caption">PHILIPPE CLUTCHED ZELIE'S HAND</span>
</div>

<p>But the first bark had awakened Tom. He
was up like a jack rabbit. He cried out to
them to stop. But they kept on running.</p>

<p>Tom was swift, and it was not long before
he overtook them. Back to the cave he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
brought them. Philippe could see that he
was very angry.</p>

<p>"Make ready to leave," he commanded
Zelie.</p>

<p>Morning was in the sky now. Tom stood
before Philippe, and his eyes flashed. But
Philippe's eyes were steady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are brave, eh?" sneered Tom. "Only
brave men will spend a night in the cave.
Well, my hero, where is the gold?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus180.jpg" width="600" height="493" alt="BACK TO THE CAVE HE BROUGHT THEM" />
<span class="caption">BACK TO THE CAVE HE BROUGHT THEM</span>
</div>

<p>Philippe answered, "I do not know, sir."</p>

<p>"Tricks!" roared Tom.</p>

<p>Then he took a stick.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a big touring car was driving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
along the road toward the cave. It was the
car belonging to the two gentlemen who had
taken Philippe to Antwerp.</p>

<p>When Papa Pomme had received the letter
from Philippe he had immediately shown
it to the gentlemen. They had been terribly
worried about the boy and had tried in every
way to help the poor parents.</p>

<p>When the two gentlemen read of Philippe's
plan to capture Tom at the cave, they immediately
told the police. Soon the big touring
car with the two gentlemen and two policemen
was on its way to the cave.</p>

<p>"This is the place," cried one of the officers.</p>

<p>The car stopped. The four men jumped
out. With their guns drawn, they entered the
cave.</p>

<p>They heard Tom laughing and saying,
"Now, after I have beaten you, perhaps you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
will not try any more tricks. We shall leave
for other lands, where you cannot escape so
easily. We shall go to France and England
and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly Tom stopped speaking. His jaw
dropped open. The stick fell from his hands.
He saw a sight that made him turn pale.
For two gentlemen and two policemen stood
in the door of the cave. Each policeman was
pointing a pistol at Tom!</p>

<p>Then the Englishman and the American
walked over to them.</p>

<p>"The plans for your trip sound very interesting,"
said the Englishman in French to
Tom. "But I am afraid we must spoil them.
There is another trip which we have planned
for you, instead."</p>

<p>The American looked very thoughtful.</p>

<p>"How in the world do you say 'prison' in
French?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"The same as in English," answered his
friend.</p>

<p>They marched outside to the car. Tom was
handcuffed. He walked between two policemen.
Zelie walked with Philippe. They entered
the big car and started off. Tom was
scowling fiercely.</p>

<p>The American smiled and said, "In our
country the children sing this song." He
sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Off to prison you must go,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You must go,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You must go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Off to prison you must go,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My fair lady!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Philippe echoed, "My fair leddy!"</p>

<p>Together they repeated the song, Zelie
joining in. Philippe did not understand what
he was singing. He did not care, for he was
very happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The road ran along the beautiful River
Meuse (mūz). Philippe watched the patient
fishermen sitting on the banks. "How peaceful
and quiet it is to stay at home!" he
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XV<br />

A NEW SONG</h2>


<p>The two gentlemen have gone back to their
respective countries.</p>

<p>Now once again Philippe and Rose sit in
the market place of Brussels.</p>

<p>Once again the little boy sells his mother's
vegetables, while the pretty baby sings to
the passers-by.</p>

<p>There is also another child. That other is
Zelie, who now lives with them. There is no
more sadness in her eyes now.</p>

<p>But Philippe has changed. He has at last
had the adventures about which he has read
and dreamed so much. And he is glad that
they are over.</p>

<p>The Belgian people say that there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
place like home, and Philippe now agrees
with them.</p>

<p>He has made up a new song. He has used
the old Belgian saying, "East, west, home's
best," for that song. Listen! Philippe and
Rose and Zelie are singing it now:</p>
